# Dataghobot

It may be possible to automate some datascience parts ?

* Technical feature engineering
* Grid search using hyperopt
* Basic stacking

This is a modest try to do so begining with hyperoptimisation of datascience models

You will need xgboost, hyperopt and the latest Anaconda distribution (for scikit-learn, pandas, numpy and scipy)
